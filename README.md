## TL;DR

The main goal of RLN v2 circuits is to make it possible to have a custom amount of messages (signals) per epoch without using a separate circuit or high-degree polynomials for [Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://rate-limiting-nullifier.github.io/rln-docs/sss.html).

## RLN V1

The [Current RLN circuit](https://github.com/Rate-Limiting-Nullifier/rln-circuits/blob/master/circuits/rln-base.circom) uses a first-degree polynomial for shares generation (and slashing). Therefore, there is a limit - one message per epoch. 

There have been attempts to make schemes in which the message limit per epoch is greater than one. For example, [N-RLN scheme](https://hackmd.io/zOk-bQ2GSgaJ1t1bI7zrWQ?view) & [N-RLN Circuits](https://github.com/Rate-Limiting-Nullifier/rln-circuits/blob/master/circuits/nrln-base.circom). But this approach is very problematic; the bigger the epoch limit, the higher the polynomial for Shamir's Secret Sharing, and the more complicated the circuit is(more R1CS, etc.).

We have generally advised using 1 message/signal per epoch and adjusting the epoch length to match the rate limit desired for your use case. However, this isnâ€™t very flexible and constrains the epoch length for all users to be the same per semaphore group (merkle tree).

### Overview of RLN v1 circuits

Before we move on, this is a quick refresher on the inputs/outputs of the RLN v1 circuits and their general purpose. If you want more detail on how RLN circuits work, please [read this](https://rate-limiting-nullifier.github.io/rln-docs/protocol_spec.html), which goes into more detail.

**Inputs**:

Public: 
* `external_nullifier` = `h(rln_identifier, epoch)` - *This identifies a unique epoch per app*, where `rln_identifier` is some unique identifier for an app and `epoch` is some unique identifier for an event or time;
* `x` = `h(message)`.

Private: 
* Secret Key `h(trapdoor, nullifier)` - This is to prove you are in some merkle tree, and to make the `y_share`, and `internal_nullifier` unique to an `id_commitment`.

**Outputs**:

* `Internal_Nullifier`
    * Used to identify a unique user during a specific epoch (external_nullifier)
* `Y_Share`
    * This is the [Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://rate-limiting-nullifier.github.io/rln-docs/sss.html) share

    a_0 --> plus --> sss([Shamir's Share y_share])
    a_0 --> h4(hash) --> id_com([id_commitment])
    h4 --> merkle(MerkleProof)

```

Instead of using higher degree polynomials to generate coefficients for higher epoch limits, we can add an input to the hash function, which is a counter `k` that ranges from 1 to `n`, the `epoch limit` (which can be `id_commitment` specific, for example in a registry contract.

The scheme would work as follows:

* The user generates a secret `a_0`
* The coefficient `a_1` is generated by taking the hash of `a_0`, an external nullifier, and the counter `k`: h(`a_0`, `external_nullifier`, `k`)
* The `internal_nullifier` is then generated by taking the hash of `a_1`: h(`a_1`)

By adding the counter `k` as an input to the hash function, the scheme becomes more flexible but still simple. It ensures that the user cannot use a value of `k` greater than `n`, which is the epoch limit, and if the user uses the same value of `k` twice, they will have two or more `internal_nullifiers` that collide, which allow the `y_shares` to be used to determine their slashing credentials.

Overall, this proposal aims to provide more flexibility to the scheme while maintaining its simplicity.

### Additional Inputs

The only additional inputs are:

* [private] Message ID (Counter) `k` - a unique id per message per epoch, somewhere between the range `1 < k < n`
* [public] Message Limit `n` - the max number of messages a user can send

### Additional Properties

There are also other cool features that come along with using this scheme:

* Internal nullifier value is different for different messages during the epoch (so it's more anonymous), even when having more than 1 signal per epoch
* It's more secure and resistant to algebraic attacks (which could arise in the N-RLN scheme linked above)

### Different Rate-Limits

By using this scheme we created a circuit, that will allow us to use different rate-limits for different users, for example based on their stake.

We can do that by committing to not only our secret, but our secret and limit:

1. Registry (map) is stored on a smart-contract, where keys are public keys (`id_commitment = Hash(identity_secret)`) of users and values are some metadata (for example `limit` number or stake amount);
2. Merkle tree, where leaves are `rate_limit`'s = `Hash(id_commitment, userMessagelimit)` 

For example, the possible limit is 1000 (`n` = 1000), and each message costs 0.001 ETH (so you will have 1000 messages limit if you stake 1 ETH).

So, when you join app you attach the amount of stake you want and also send the `id_commitment` and `rate_commitment = Hash(id_commitment, userMessageLimit)` will be calculated on-chain based on your stake.

Signaling will use other circuit, where your `limit` is private input, and the counter `k` is checked that it's in the range from 1 to `userMessageLimit`.
